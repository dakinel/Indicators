# Building a Stock App for Technical Analysis

This document outlines the steps required to create a stock application focused on technical analysis, leveraging the existing `@debut/indicators` library.

## Project Goal

The goal is to develop a user-friendly web application that allows users to:

1.  Select a stock.
2.  Choose a date range.
3.  Select and display various technical indicators.
4.  View a chart with the stock's price and selected indicators.

## Leveraging Existing Assets

The current project provides a robust library (`@debut/indicators`) with a wide range of technical indicators. We will leverage this library to avoid reimplementing common indicators.

## Required Steps

1.  **Frontend Framework Setup:**

    *   **Choose a Framework:** Select a JavaScript framework for building the user interface. Recommendations include React, Vue.js, or Angular.
    *   **Project Initialization:** Create a new project using the chosen framework's CLI (e.g., `create-react-app`, `vue create`).
    *   **Dependency Installation:** Install necessary dependencies like charting libraries and any HTTP client for API requests.
    *   `npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2 axios` for react, for example.

2.  **Data Source Integration:**

    *   **Select a Financial API:** Choose a reliable API that provides stock data (historical and/or real-time). Examples:
        *   Alpha Vantage
        *   IEX Cloud
        *   Tiingo
        *   Polygon.io
    *   **API Key:** Obtain an API key from the chosen provider.
    *   **Data Fetching Module:** Create a module to handle API requests:
        *   Fetch stock data for a given symbol and date range.
        *   Handle API responses and errors.
        *   Format the data as needed for the application.

3.  **Charting Library Integration:**

    *   **Choose a Charting Library:** Select a charting library to visualize the stock data and indicators. Examples:
        *   Chart.js
        *   TradingView (commercial)
        *   Recharts
    *   **Chart Component:** Create a component that takes in stock price data and indicator data and renders a chart.
    *   **Data Formatting:** Ensure that the data from the API is properly formatted for the charting library.
    * **Candlestick Support:** Ensure that your plotting library support candlestick display, as this is what the community is used to.

4.  **Indicator Integration (`@debut/indicators`):**

    *   **Installation:** Install the `@debut/indicators` package into your frontend project:
```
bash
    npm install @debut/indicators
    
```
*   **Indicator Calculation:**
        *   Create a module to interact with the `@debut/indicators` library.
        *   Define functions to calculate indicators (e.g., `calculateRSI`, `calculateMACD`).
        *   These functions will take in the stock data as an array of closing prices, open prices, highs, and lows, and return the calculated indicator values.
    *   **Importing Indicators:** Import the required indicators from `@debut/indicators`.
```
javascript
        import { RSI, MACD, EMA } from '@debut/indicators';
        
```
* **Parameterization:** All of the indicators are highly parameterizable, make sure you allow users to edit the parameters in the UI.

5.  **Application Structure:**

    *   **Components:** Create the following UI components:
        *   **Stock Selector:** A dropdown or input field to choose a stock symbol.
        *   **Date Range Picker:** Inputs or a date picker to specify the start and end dates.
        *   **Indicator Selector:** A list of checkboxes or a dropdown to select indicators.
        *   **Chart:** The chart component to display the stock data and indicators.
        *   **Layout:** Components to structure the overall layout.
    *   **Data Flow:**
        *   When the user selects a stock and a date range, fetch the data from the API.
        *   Calculate the selected indicators using the `@debut/indicators` library.
        *   Pass both the raw data and the indicator data to the chart component.
    * **Error handling:** Add appropriate errors messages, for when no data is found, or for when the API is unavailable.

6.  **User Interactions:**

    *   **Stock Selection:** Allow users to enter or select a stock symbol.
    *   **Date Range:** Allow users to choose a date range.
    *   **Indicator Selection:** Provide a UI for users to select which indicators to display.
    *   **Chart Updates:** Update the chart dynamically whenever the user changes the stock, date range, or indicators.

7.  **Testing:**

    *   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for data fetching, indicator calculation, and any critical logic.
    *   **UI Tests:** Write UI tests to ensure components render correctly and interactions work as expected.

## Example Data Flow

1.  User selects "AAPL" and a date range.
2.  App fetches historical data for AAPL from the API.
3.  User selects "RSI" and "MACD" indicators.
4.  App calculates RSI and MACD values using the `@debut/indicators` library.
5.  App passes the stock data, RSI values, and MACD values to the chart component.
6.  Chart component renders the data.

## Conclusion

By following these steps and leveraging the existing `@debut/indicators` library, you can build a stock app for technical analysis efficiently. This project outline provides a strong foundation for development.
